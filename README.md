# 🛒 Javascript Amazon Project — E-commerce Simulation

A static e-commerce web application simulation built with **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project mimics core functionalities of a shopping platform, including product browsing, cart management, checkout flow, and order tracking.

## 🚀 About The Project
This repository serves as a **hands-on playground** to practice advanced JavaScript concepts without relying on heavy frameworks. The focus is on understanding the underlying logic of modern web apps.

**Key Features:**
* **Product Browsing:** Dynamic rendering of products using JavaScript.
* **Shopping Cart:** Add/Remove items, update quantities, and persistent data using `localStorage`.
* **Checkout System:** Calculates shipping costs, tax, and total price accurately using external libraries (DayJS).
* **Order Management:** Simulates order placement and history tracking.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+ Modules)
* **Libraries:** [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) (for date manipulation), Jasmine (for testing - *if applicable*)
* **Architecture:** MVC-inspired structure (separating Data, View, and Logic)

## 📂 Project Structure
* `/script` — Client-side logic (Modular JS files)
* `/styles` — CSS styling
* `/data` — Mock data (Products, Cart, Delivery Options)
* `amazon.html` — Main landing page
* `checkout.html` — Checkout process
* `orders.html` — Order history

## 🏁 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Phichak-Kamin/JavascriptAmazonProject.git](https://github.com/Phichak-Kamin/JavascriptAmazonProject.git)
    ```
2.  **Run the project:**
    * Simply open `amazon.html` in your browser.
    * **Recommended:** Use "Live Server" extension in VS Code or run a simple local server:
        ```bash
        npx serve .
        ```

## 📚 Learning Goals & Skills Practiced
This project was built to strengthen the following skills:
* **DOM Manipulation:** efficient updating of the UI.
* **Data Structure:** Managing complex arrays of objects (cart, products).
* **Modules:** Using ES6 `import`/`export` to organize code.
* **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Understanding Promises and callbacks (future implementation).
* **Real-world Logic:** Handling currency (cents vs dollars), shipping dates, and tax calculations.


## 🙏 Acknowledgements
* Inspired by the **SuperSimpleDev** JavaScript Course.
* Product images and mock data structure adapted for educational use.
